# GODOT Mesh Manipulation

I'm following along this series https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWWV0KoRkFHAMR27dAy3YsJHbkCGpIuAF I did skip 01 so ...yeah. Only thing so far I noticed is that I didn't import in anything from Blender, I just created a MeshInstance that had a cube body. Didn't even know it was different till it was brought up way later.

Started branching at the beginning of video 08.
